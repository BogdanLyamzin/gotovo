    "text-1": "The project of the new administrative services center was presented in July 2015. It was just an idea, there wasn't even a name for the project yet - it had come later. In early August 2016, the document service \"GOTOVO\" opened the doors for the first visitors.",
    "text-2": "Construction began in March 2016 and was completed in a record 4 months.",
    "text-3": "There was a fundamental requirement for the building - it had to be transparent. After all, according to the concept, while entering the institution, the visitor should feel 'openness and transparency.' That is why the walls of the building are made of glass. There are no offices or partitions inside.",
    "text-4": "To make it even more comfortable, a cafe was arranged."
